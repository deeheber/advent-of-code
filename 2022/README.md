# advent-of-code-2022

Challenges from https://adventofcode.com/2022

To run a solution navigate to the 2022 directory run either of the following commands:

- `node day-{day number}/part-{part number}.js`
- `day={day number} part={part number} npm start`

I ran the solutions using node 18.x, but it may work with other node versions.
