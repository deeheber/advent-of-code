# advent-of-code-2023

Challenges from https://adventofcode.com/2023

To run a solution navigate to the 2023 directory run either of the following commands:

- `node day-{day number}/part-{part number}.js`
- `day={day number} part={part number} npm start`

I ran the solutions using node 20.x (see `.nvmrc`), but it may work with other node versions.

To use the prettier formatter run `npm run format` (after running `npm install`)

I could've used TypeScript, but to me that felt like overkill for something like this. Decided to go with plain JS using modules instead.
